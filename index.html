  <!-- AWS PROJECTS -->
  <section>
    <h2>AWS Projects & Hands-on</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Serverless Feedback System</h3>
      <p>
        Built a fully serverless feedback collection system using AWS services.
        The system uses an S3-hosted static frontend with a feedback form, which
        triggers an AWS Lambda function via API Gateway. The Lambda function
        processes the input and stores it in a DynamoDB table. This project
        demonstrates event-driven architecture, secure API integration, and
        real-time data capture without managing any servers.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Portfolio Website on AWS</h3>
      <p>
        Designed and deployed a personal portfolio website using HTML, CSS, and
        JavaScript. The site is hosted on Amazon S3 with static website hosting
        and accelerated using CloudFront for global delivery. This project
        showcases my cloud deployment skills and serves as a live resume for
        recruiters.
